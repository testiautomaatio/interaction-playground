# Browser interaction playground for test automation


On this site, you can practice interacting with different types of elements. Each page has a set of challenges that you can complete using your test automation tool. The challenges are designed to help you practice interacting with different types of elements and to help you learn how to write automated tests.

The challenges are designed to be compatible with any test automation tool that can interact with web pages. The challenges also aim to resemble real-world scenarios that you might encounter when writing automated tests for web applications, such as interacting with forms, tables, and responsive web pages.
